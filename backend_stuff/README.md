## Backend Server for Dining Hall App (with example cilent)

There are two applications in this folder. 

1. "./server" : RESTful API server that pulls the data from google sheet and sends JSON back to the GET requests.
2. "./example_client" : Simple React page that sends the requests to RESTful server (in 1.)
	
**They must be run separately.**

### Running the RESTful API server (1.)
	
1. Go to server directory `cd ./server/`
2. If this is the first time, you must install dependencies `npm install`
3. Running the server with `npm start` or `node main.js`. For linux : `nodejs main.js`
4. The server will running at http://localhost:8080/
	
### Running the example_client

1. Go to client directory `cd ./example_client/`
2. If this is the first time, you must install dependencies `npm install`
3. Open example_client/src/Sheets.js with text editor.
4. Edit the variable named api_url
   - For connection to local API server, change it to `http://localhost:8080/`
   - For connection to online server, change it to `http://45.32.165.208:8080/`
5. Running the server with `npm start` or `node main.js`. For linux : `nodejs main.js`
4. The server will running at http://localhost:3000/

**Note:** For production, you have to build the react applications by `npm build` 
and upload static files generated by react in './build' somewhere, such as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
This will merge all files together into 3-4 files.
